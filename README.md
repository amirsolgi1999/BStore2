My Awesome Android App
This is a modern Android application built with Kotlin and powered by Jetpack Compose, delivering a sleek, intuitive, and highly responsive user interface. The app follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture combined with Clean Architecture principles to ensure a clean, modular, scalable, and maintainable codebase. It leverages Room for robust local data persistence and Retrofit for seamless network operations, providing a smooth and efficient user experience.
Features

Modern UI: Built with Jetpack Compose, offering a fluid and visually appealing interface with smooth animations.
Clean MVVM Architecture: Combines MVVM with Clean Architecture, separating concerns into presentation, domain, and data layers for improved testability and maintainability.
Local Data Storage: Utilizes Room for reliable and efficient offline data management.
Network Integration: Uses Retrofit for fast and secure API communication.
Scalable Design: Structured with Clean Architecture to support future enhancements and maintainability.

Architecture
The app follows Clean Architecture with MVVM, organized into three main layers:

Presentation Layer: Contains Jetpack Compose UI components and ViewModels, handling user interactions and UI state.
Domain Layer: Houses business logic, use cases, and domain models, ensuring independence from UI and data layers.
Data Layer: Manages data sources (Room database and Retrofit API calls) and provides a single source of truth via repositories.

This structure ensures separation of concerns, testability, and scalability.
